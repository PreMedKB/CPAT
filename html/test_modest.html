<p>Report Time: Fri Mar 18 17:35:32 2022</p>
<p>Biogeographic Group: Oceanian</p>
<h2>Pharmacogenomics Summary</h2>
<p>CPAT calculated the effect scores of the drugs of interest in the five phenotype categories based on the genotypes obtained from the analysis. Evidence levels 1A, 1B, 2, 3, and 4 are used to indicate the degree of influence of a drug on a particular drug response.</p>
